## Short description of change (less than 60 chars recommended)
<!--
type: breaking, feature or bugfix
scope: internal, external or all
affected: all, componentA, CI, GUI or any other custom string separated by ","
-->

Describe what you have changed this time may using the full set of markdown.

Nested titles in here need to be nested with `###` or more

- another thing to mention as list
- feels good
    - sub items are there as well
    - `-` is just a recommendation, `+` or `*` can be used as well

Use some code highlighting e.g.

Changing the for loop variable name `i` to `a` did not solve the issue.

To find the effective username of the current user use

```bash
whoami
```

Also language specific highlighting can be done, creating an even beautifuller
changelog entry

```python
def say_hello(name: str) -> None:
    print(f"Hello {name}")


say_hello(name="Changelog Generator User")
```

Or some JSON data structure

```json
{
    "key": [
        "value",
        "other"
    ],
    "second": 2
}
```

May also use *italic* or even **bold** to create some attention.

[Example inline links](http://lmgtfy.com/) or [reference based][ref1] links
can be usefull as well.

And finally some tables for your reference
